# my-test-bot
My test task

The bot uses the mySQL database to work. 
To run on another device,
the corresponding database must also be deployed, 
the current database URI must be specified in the
application.yml file

There is also database dump file in the root/export-sql/test-bot-dump.sql file
It stores vital data without which the bot will not work, 
so it is necessary to import it in the mySQL environment
